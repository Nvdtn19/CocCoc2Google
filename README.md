# CocCoc2Google

By default in CocCoc browser, you can change the search engine from Coc Coc to Google in the browser settings, but this change only affects the address bar, not the search box which shows when opening a new tab. Therefore, this extension will automatically redirect the search engine from Coc Coc to Google, when using either the address bar or the search box.
